# Things 3 theme for Obsidian
Version: 1.5.2
Updated: 2025-03-27

This theme is aimed to provide consistent experience to those who use Obsidian together with Things 3. It has been tested on macOS, iPadOS, and iOS only.
Just my take on Things 3 integration, by providing visual consistency between the two applications. 

Hope you'll enjoy it!

Don't mix it with legendary [Things Theme](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://github.com/colineckert/obsidian-things&ved=2ahUKEwiy3Li9oY-MAxUOSPEDHZGqKVUQFnoECBUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2YUK11ZDLIbbSD1G9rrdi-) by Colin Eckert!

## Features
- Exact color match with Things 3 for Light and Dark options, Desktop and Mobile
- Things 3 like Animations
- Things 3 like Sidebar
- Things 3 like Quick Switcher
- Things 3 like Menus
- Things 3 like Tags (hidden #)
- Things 3 like Mobile Toolbar (kudos to [Alex the Creator of Cupertino theme](https://github.com/aaaaalexis) for some of the code I borrowed)
- Hidden Tab Close button until hover for more space
- Fancy highlighter
- Black background for Dark theme on Mobiles
- Prettified Code Blocks
- Full-size YT Previews
- Full-width Mobile sidebars
- Custom checkboxes by [Kepano](https://stephango.com)

## Integrations
- [Dataview] No-wrap rows
- [Dataview] More accurate table borders and overall look
- [Daily Notes Calendar] Customizations to match Things 3 look
- [Calendar] Custom Today button to match Things 3 look
- [Iconize] default color overrides separately for Light and Dark options
- [Iconize] fancy animations make whole sidebar smooth
- [Iconize] fixed icon margin so you don't have to fiddle with settings (later will be added to Style Settings to switch this off)
- [Ink] Some minor adjustments to better fit theme aesthetics

NOTE: This theme seems to be not compatible with **Iconic** plugin!

It is recommended to be used with these plugins:
- Iconize
- Daily Note Calendar
- Better Search Views

Give it a try!
