# Things 3 theme for Obsidian
Version: 1.2

This is a different theme, don't mix it with legendary [Things Theme](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://github.com/colineckert/obsidian-things&ved=2ahUKEwiy3Li9oY-MAxUOSPEDHZGqKVUQFnoECBUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2YUK11ZDLIbbSD1G9rrdi-) by Colin Eckert!
