# Things 3 theme for Obsidian
Version: 2.3.9
Updated: 2025-09-05

This theme is aimed to provide consistent experience to those who use Obsidian together with Things 3. It has been tested on macOS, iPadOS, and iOS only.
Just my take on Things 3 integration, by providing visual consistency between the two applications. 

Hope you'll enjoy it!

Don't mix it with legendary [Things Theme](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://github.com/colineckert/obsidian-things&ved=2ahUKEwiy3Li9oY-MAxUOSPEDHZGqKVUQFnoECBUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2YUK11ZDLIbbSD1G9rrdi-) by Colin Eckert!

## Features
- Exact color match with Things 3 for Light and Dark options, Desktop and Mobile
- Things 3 like Animations, including Pull Down menu on mobiles
- Things 3 like Sidebar
- Things 3 like Quick Switcher
- Things 3 like Menus
- Things 3 like Checkboxes
- Things 3 like Tags (hidden #)
- Things 3 like Mobile Toolbar (kudos to [Alex the Creator of Cupertino theme](https://github.com/aaaaalexis) for some of the code I borrowed)
- Hidden Tab Close button until hover for more space
- Fancy highlighter
- Prettified Code Blocks
- Full-size YT Previews
- Full-width Mobile sidebars
- Style Settings support
- Black background for Dark theme on Mobiles
- Ability to have Tab Close button on the left
- Custom checkboxes by [Kepano](https://stephango.com)
- Ability to change mobile navbar to pre-1.9 state (back & forward, search buttons)

## Integrations
- [Dataview] No-wrap rows
- [Dataview] More accurate table borders and overall look
- [Daily Notes Calendar] Customizations to match Things 3 look
- [Calendar] Custom Today button to match Things 3 look
- [Iconize] default color overrides separately for Light and Dark options
- [Iconize] fancy animations make whole sidebar smooth
- [Iconize] fixed icon margin so you don't have to fiddle with settings (later will be added to Style Settings to switch this off)
- [Ink] Some minor adjustments to better fit theme aesthetics
- [Zen Mode] More space to the inline title and slight padding adjustments for the icon
- [Iconic] since 2.3.4 finally works with this plugin as well :) 

NOTE: This theme seems to be not compatible with **Iconic** plugin!

It is recommended to be used with these plugins:
- Iconize
- Daily Note Calendar
- Better Search Views

Give it a try!
